# FizzBuzz - TDD Kata

## Task 1:
Write a function that takes a number as an argument and, based on the scenarios described below, returns `"Fizz"`, `"Buzz"`, `"FizzBuzz"` or that number.

   - If the number is divisible by 3, return `"Fizz"`.
   - If the number is divisible by 5, return `"Buzz"`.
   - If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, return `"FizzBuzz"`.
   - If none of above applies, return the number as is.

### Sample output:
```console
- 1 => "1"
- 2 => "2"
- 3 => "Fizz"
- 4 => "4"
- 5 => "Buzz"
- 6 => "Fizz"
- 10 => "Buzz"
- 11 => "11"
- 15 => "FizzBuzz"
```

## Task 2: 
Write a function that takes a number as an argument and, based on the same scenarios described above, prints the number.

## Task 3: 
Write a function that takes user input and prints that number, based on the same scenarios described above.
   - If user input is not a number, throw an exception with the message: "{inputNumber} is not a number".
